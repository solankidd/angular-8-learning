- how to pass data to other component?
  - go to app component

  - <app-cockpit [serverElements]="serverElementsAppCmp"></app-cockpit>
  - here serverElementsAppCmp is part of app comp ts
  - serverElements is part of app-cockpit component
  - so from app-cockpit.ts will update serverElements, serverElements is connected to
    serverElementsAppCmp so parent will know that cockpit updated the array.

  - similarly,
    - app-server-element is having 'element' property
    - app-server-element is getting serverElement from app component
