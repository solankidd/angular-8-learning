- how to pass data to other component?
  - go to app component

  - <app-cockpit [serverElements]="serverElementsAppCmp"></app-cockpit>
  - here serverElementsAppCmp is part of app comp ts
  - serverElements is part of app-cockpit component
  - so from app-cockpit.ts will update serverElements, serverElements is connected to
    serverElementsAppCmp so parent will know that cockpit updated the array.

  - similarly,
    - app-server-element is having 'element' property
    - app-server-element is getting serverElement from app component

  - alias:
    - go to app-component
    - check <app-server-element
      *ngFor="let serverElement of serverElementsAppCmp"
      [element]="serverElement" aliasOutside="Alias test"></app-server-element>
    - here, aliasOutside is parameter we are passing to app-server-element
    - app-server-element ts file have @Input('aliasOutside') aliasInside;
    - so from outside it will be passed as aliasOutside and from inside component we can refer as
      aliasInside

  - custom event  emit
    - in cockpit we created events
      - @Output() serverCreated = new EventEmitter<{ serverName: string; serverContent: string }>();
      - @Output() bluePrintCreated = new EventEmitter<{ serverName: string; serverContent: string }>();
    - which will emit the newly added data
    - in cockpit we have buttons to add-server and add-bluePrintCreated
    - on click of that buttons we will emit above event
      - onAddServer() {
        // we are emitting our event and giving data
        this.serverCreated.emit({
          serverName: this.newServerName,
          serverContent: this.newServerContent
        });
      }
    - now we will need to listen this event in main app component
     - now app component have app-cockpit component
     - we will add app-cockpit event name into it like:
      - <app-cockpit (serverCreated)="onServerAddedInsideCockpit($event)"></app-cockpit>
      - serverCreated is event emitted from cockpit
      - whenever serverCreated is emitted, onServerAddedInsideCockpit will be called
      - onServerAddedInsideCockpit is placed inside app.component
      - so child component(cockpit) is emitting event and parent component(app) is listening it
      - you can put this ( <app-cockpit (serverCreated)="onServerAddedInsideCockpit($event)"></app-cockpit> ) in
        cockpit component only because this is the component which is emitting event
      - you can not bind this event in other component, because that component is not emitting this event
    - THIS IS HOW FLOW IS WORKING
      - 1. emit event from cockpit
      - 2. listen event in app.component by attaching app.component function to parameters of cockpit component
      - now whenever cockpit component add button is hit it will emit event
        as app component is listening it, it will execute the function on event

STYLES:
  - css style will be applied to particular component where it is written
  - if you put style p{ color: blue } inside app.component.css it will not apply to other component
  - angular selects it by applying dynamic attribute to component
  - like p['_ngContent-ejo-2']{ color: blue } like lightning UI

  - you can apply GLOBAL styles by putting it to '\src\styles.css'
   - ref of this can be found in angular.json file

  - you can disable this  behavior by adding parameter in component decorator
   - like
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
      encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None // this one
    })
    - none will not apply this shadow dom thing
    - Emulated is default which will emulate shadow dom technology with angular8
    - ShadowDom will use browser's dom shadow technology which may not be supported by all browser
